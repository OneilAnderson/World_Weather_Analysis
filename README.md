# World_Weather_Analysis

## Summary

In this analysis, we were asked to make changes to the PlanMyTrip app that we developed over the module. We are asked to incorporate the weather description to the weather data and to add a weather preference for the users of the app to specify their travel destinations. From this, the testers of the app will create a travel itinerary using four different cities. Finally, we included the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route through the cities and back to the original position.
